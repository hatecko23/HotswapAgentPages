Save&amp;Reload during development should be standard and many other languages (including C#) contain this feature.</p><p>This project is still in a beta version.</p><h3>Easy to start</h3><p>Download and install latest <a href="https://github.com/dcevm/dcevm/releases">DCEVM Java patch</a> + <a href="https://github.com/HotswapProjects/HotswapAgent/releases">agent jar</a> and launch your application server with options <code>-XXaltjvm=dcevm -javaagent:hotswap-agent.jar</code> to get basic setup. You can attach <a href="https://github.com/HotswapProjects/HotswapAgent/releases">agent jar</a> to the running JVM using the following example <a href="https://gist.github.com/xnike/a268fc209df52bf1bf09a268e97cef53">code snippet</a>. Optionally add hotswap-agent.properties to your application to configure plugins and agent behaviour.</p><h3>Plugins</h3><p>Each application framework (Spring, Hibernate, Logback, ...) needs special reloading mechanism to keep up-to-date after class redefinition (e.g. Hibernate configuration reload after new entity class is introduced). Hotswap agent works as a plugin system and ships preconfigured with all major framework plugins. It is easy to write your custom plugin even as part of your application.</p><h3>Contribute</h3><p>This project is very complex due to lot of supported frameworks and various versions. Community contribution is mandatory to keep it alive. You can start by creating a plugin inside your application or by writing an example/integration test. There is always need for documentation improvement :-). Thank you for any help!</p>
